# Major project proposal

## Project description

I intend on making a mostly accurate version of the original Pac Man, with many of the same visuals and sounds. Where the player will be able to move in the four cardinal directions, eat pellets/super pellets and maybe fruits. There will also be the four ghost as the enemys and the player will be able to eat them after eating a super pellet. The code will hopefully recreat the ghosts pathfinding as accurately as possible, 

## Needs to have list

- The same or very similar visuals and sounds to the original game.
- The gameplay will be the same or as close to the original game as possible.
- The first level of the game.
- Accurate pathinding for the ghosts.
- The points systeme used in the original game.
- The ability to save hight scores.

## Nice to have list

- More levels.
- Title screen/U.I.
- Settings and options such as changing the diffculty, color/backgrounds, framerate/performance and especially button/key mapping.
- The ability for a second player to controle one or more of the ghosts, or just multiplayer in some form.
-
