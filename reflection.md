If I were to do a project like this again my advice to myself would be to try to give myself more time to finish it. I had a plan for the three big parts of the project, being getting the player movement seperate from the grid, getting the pellets to work correctly and getting the ghost enemies to move along the path and pathfind to different locations based on thier state. I had general time frames for these tasks but I slightly underestimated how long it would take to finsh the ghosts part and know it's going to come down to the wire to finish my needs to have list and some things on it may have to suffer in order to get y three big tasks done.
