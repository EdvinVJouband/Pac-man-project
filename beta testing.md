My mom tested for me. She had trouble moving the player throught the level. Because the player needs to be ligned up precisely to fit throught the paths seh had trouble moving vertically. But when she figured out you could hold two keys at once to essentaily move diagnaly she got the hang of it.

- I should have made the movement more intuitive if I had more time

My brother tried it out and when he saw that my ghost was miss alighned when moving throught the path and that it was happening because I was caluting the ghost based on when the midle of the ghost enters a cell. He told me to claculate when the ghost passes the midle of a cell so he would be aligned correctly.

- I took his advice and I was able to fix this probleme I spent hours trying to slove and apllyied his solution to fix it in less than a half hour.
